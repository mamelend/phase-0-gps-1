How does Git track changes? 

N: Git tracks changes by different stages. When you are working on a file, the file is in a working state. When you use the command git add, the file becomes stages, and git commit, commits the file so that it can be pushed to Github. From Github you can merge the changes into the master branch, which is the final step for making the changes.
