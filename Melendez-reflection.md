**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
*I don't think there were any issues that I was struggling with per say, but this did help solidify some things that I wasn't super clear on. *


**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
*The ideas of fetching and merging were a little vague to me. I am glad to have gone through that for a better idea of what those do. Nathan and I also ran some tests at the end, and it was cool to figure out how to do some of the markdown stuff too.*


**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
*We asked mostly for clarification on the assignment. I think for the most part, Nathan and I were able to navigate through the assignment without much trouble (apart from network related issues)*


**What still confuses you about git?
*I'd like some more expereince with merge conflicts. Nathan and I did spend some extra time making changes to different parts of the same file, and it seemed as though that works just fine.*


**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
*The most challenging part were the network issues, dealing with background noise, latency, disconnections etc. I think apart from that Nathan and I worked well together and I think we both demonstrated a good understanding of the command line. Nathan taught me that I could use the ~ to refer to the main directory, which is super useful for getting around the computer in the command line. I'm eager for more and I look forward to latency free experiences haha!*
