**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
  I was struggling with the definition of the git status. We have untrack, staged, committed. But on the quiz last week I saw an answer of working status, which got me confused.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
  The git status is clarified after consulting my pair.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
  I asked the guide about the conflict while multiple changes happened to the same file. After experimenting, we found out that conflict will happen if there is different modification in the same place in the same file. But changes in different places in the same file will not cause conflict.

**What still confuses you about git?**
  I am still a bit confused on the convension of the commit message. I'll search for more information to match the standard message format.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
  It was a very interesting experience to work with a guide and my pair. I get to know my pair's study habit and thought process, as well as how to collaborate in problem solving. The importance of communication is emphasized as we progress during the section.
